Myrick family, S. P. M. (2022). This is Sean P. Myricks database of citation files that spans across all of his projects that contain citation files. This repository bundles them up, and acts as a portal tool to pinpoint citation files. A copy of all citation files is present here. You can cite this repository if you want to cite the database itself, but you need to use the included citation files or navigate to the citable projects in order to cite them individually or in bulk.
